  "Our Father whiche arte in heaven. Halowed
   be thy Name: Thy kingdome come.
   Thy wil bedone even in earthe as it in heavene.
   Geve us thys day our daily Bread. And forgive
   us our trespasses, as we forgive our trespassers.
   And leade us not in to temptation. Butt
   delyver us from evyll. For thine is the Kingdome,
   and the power, and the glory forever. Amen."
