  "Our Father which art in heaven.
   Be hallowed thine name.
   Come thy Kingdome.
   Be thy will so as in heaven and in earth.
   Our lofe super substantiall give us to day.
   And forgive us debttes ours, so we forgive debtters ours.
   And do not lade us in to temptation.
   But deliver everyone from evill.
   Amen."
