  "Our Father wych arte in heaven. haloued bee
   thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thyl will
   be done in erth as it is in heauen.
   Geue vs this day our dayly bread. And forgeue
   uss our trespasses, as we forgeue yame that
   trespasse agaynst vs. And lead vs nocht in to 
   temptacyon, bot deliuer vs from euyl."
