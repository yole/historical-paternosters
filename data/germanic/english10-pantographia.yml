  "Our father which art in heaven. Halowed be
   thy name. Let thy Kingdom come. Thy will
   be fulfilled, as well in earth as it is in heaven.
   Give ous this day our dayly bread. And forgive
   ous our trespasses, even as we forgive
   our trespassers. And lead ous not into temptation.
   But delyver ous from evyl. Amen."
