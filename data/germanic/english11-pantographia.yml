text:
  "O our father which art in heauen halowed be
   thy name. Let thy kingdome come. Thy wyll
   be done, as well in earth, as it is in heauen.
   Give vs this Day our dayly breade. And forgyue
   vs our dettes, as we forgyue our detters.
   And leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer
   vs from euill: for thine is the kingdome, and
   the power, and the glorie, for euer. Amen."
