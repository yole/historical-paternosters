text:
  "Our Father which art in Heaven hallowed bee
   thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will
   bee done even in Earth as it is in Heaven.
   Give us this Day our daily Bread and forgive
   us our Dettes, as wee also forgive our Detters.
   And leade us not into Temptation but deliver
   us from evil: for thine is the Kingdom, and
   the Power and the Glory for ever. Amen."
