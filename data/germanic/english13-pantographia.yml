text:
  "Our Father who art in Heaven, sacredly reverenced
   be thy Name; Let thy Kingdom
   come; may thy Will be done, even on Earth
   according as in Heaven; Give us our daily
   bread to day; and forgive us our trespasses,
   as we also forgive those that trespass against
   us; and do not bring us into trial, but deliver
   us from wickedness; since the Kingdom,
   Power and Glory is thine for ever: so let it be."
