text:
  "Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be
   thy Name; thy kingdom come; thy will be
   done in earth as it is in heaven; give us this
   day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts
   as we forgive our debtors: and lead us not
   into temptation, but deliver us from evil: for
   thine is the kingdom and the power and the
   glory for ever. Amen."
