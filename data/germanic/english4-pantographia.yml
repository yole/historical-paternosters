  Fadir ur that es in hevene,
  Halud be thi Nam to nevene:
  Thou do us thi rich rike,
  Thi Will erd be wroght elk:
  As it is wroght in Heven ay,
  Ur ilk Day Brede give us to Day:
  Forgive thou all us dettes urs
  As we forgive till ur detturs
  And ledde us in na fanding
  But sculd us fra ivel Thing.
