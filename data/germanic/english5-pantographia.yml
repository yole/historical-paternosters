  Fader that art in heavin riche,
  Thin helge nam it wurth the blisse,
  Cumen and mot thy kingdom,
  Thin holy will it be all don,
  In heaven and in erdh also.
  So it shall bin full well Ic tro.
  Gif us all bread on this day,
  And forgif us ure sinnes.
  As we do ure wider winnes:
  Let us not in fonding fall,
  Oac fro evil thu syld us all. Amen.
