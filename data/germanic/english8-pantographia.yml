  "Our Father which art in Heven, halowed be
   thy Name. Let thy Kingdom come; thy will
   be fulfilled as well in Earth as it is in Heven.
   Geve us this daye in dayly bred; and forgeve
   us oure detters. And leade us not into Temptation; 
   but delyver us from evyll. For thyne
   is the Kyngdom, and the power and the glorye
   for ever. Amen."
