text:
  "O oure Father which arte in heven halowed be
   thy name. Let thy kingdome come. Thy will
   be fulfilled, as well in erth, as it is in heven.
   Geve us this daye oure dayly bred. And forgeve
   us our treaspases, even as we forgeve
   oure trespacers. And lead us not into temptacion,
   but delyver us from evyll. Amen."
